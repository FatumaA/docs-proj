To get a list of all characters from Rick and Morty API, construct your query like this:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "query GetAllCharacters { characters { results { id name status species type gender origin { name } location { name } image episode { id name air_date episode created } created } } }"}' \
  https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql

```



The results will be a JSON object containing a results array. You can see an example of this below:

<Code lang="json" title="results shape" code={resultingJSon} />

## Customise the result

You can customise the resulting Json array by passing the following parameters:

<Steps>

1. `name`

    Filter by the given name.

2. `status`

	  Filter by the given status (alive, dead or unknown).

3. `species`

	Filter by the given species.

4. `type`
  
    Filter by the given type.

5. `gender`
    
    Filter by the given gender (`female`, `male`, `genderless` or `unknown`).

</Steps>

For example, to get only characters named "Rick", you can use customise the `name` parameter like this:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": "query GetAllCharacters { characters(filter:{name:\"Rick\"}) { results { id name status species type gender origin { name } location { name } image episode { id name air_date episode created } created } } }"
  }' \

```
